Это включает в себя распределение доходов с фильмов, класс фильмов, распределение доходов по разным категориям и связь между продолжительностью фильма и доходами. Анализ данных фильмов показывает, что ключевыми факторами их успеха являются высокая оценка критиков и зрителей, известные актеры и режиссеры, а также широкий выбор жанров и длительности. Эти характеристики подтверждают, что фильмы, входящие в анализируемую выборку, пользуются большим спросом и высоко оцениваются за их содержание и качество. Тем не менее, различия в коммерческих доходах и рейтингах могут свидетельствовать о том, что жанровые предпочтения и возрастные ограничения оказывают значительное влияние на зрительскую аудиторию, а также на кассовые сборы."
